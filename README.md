* Object data types. Class vs Intances members. Encapsulation. Public, protected, private sections.
* lvalue / rvalue distinction. What is each, what binds with what.
* Iterators. General use, for-range. Reverse and const iterators. Iterators on old c-style arrays.
* References and pointers. Functions as pointers. Primitive arrays as pointers.
* Scopes and lifetimes. Namespaces.
* Storage duration. Global variable, automatic variable and dynamic variable scopes.
* const vs constexpr
* volatile keyword.
* Function types. Argument passing: copy vs reference. Overloads. Function signature.
* Constructors. Initialization vs. assignment. Use of explicit.
* Basic STL. Containers. I/O and strings.
* std algorithms
* Program build stages. Preprocessing, compilation and linking.
* Structure of a program. Header files, source files, object files.
* Expressions and statements. Control flow.
* Program build tools. Compilers (gcc/clang), linkers (ld/llvm) and build systems (make/cmake).
